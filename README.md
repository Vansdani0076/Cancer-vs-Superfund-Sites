# Cancer-vs-Superfund-Sites
Analysis of data linking cancer to proximity of contamination
# Cancer Rates and Proximity to Superfund Sites

## Overview

This portfolio project explores the relationship between cancer incidence rates and geographic proximity to Superfund sites across the United States. Superfund sites are polluted locations requiring long-term cleanup of hazardous material contamination, and this project aims to investigate whether living near these sites correlates with higher cancer rates. This project was created using MS Copilot.

## Objectives

- Analyze spatial data to identify communities located near Superfund sites.
- Integrate cancer incidence data from public health sources.
- Perform statistical and geospatial analysis to detect patterns or correlations.
- Visualize findings through maps, charts, and interactive dashboards.
- Communicate insights in a clear, accessible format for public awareness and policy consideration.

## Data Sources

- **Superfund Site Locations**: EPA Superfund Program
- **Cancer Incidence Rates**: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/data/index.htm*: [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.censusgies

- Python: Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium
- Jupyter Notebooks
- QGIS or other GIS software (optional)
- Git & GitHub for version control
